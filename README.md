# Zordle

based on the popular game, "wordle" (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

## Work in Progress!

_it is important to note that this app is merely a biproduct of a single developer's attempt at tackling zk-proofs and
and exploring the aleo platform, although playable, it is far from finished._

firstly, there is no game state. unlike the original game, players can submit as many guesses as they like and there
is no logic for when the game is won. in future implementations, challengers' guess attempts will be restricted by some
owner specifed ruleset. scoring will be based on how many attempts consumed before the win.

lacking contraints. currently, it is possible to cheat the game in more ways than one. however, these methods are
trivial to fix and certainly will be in future implementations.

at some point, would love to pair this with reactle (https://reactle.vercel.app) an open-source wordle clone in react.
this would really bring zordle to life!

## QuickStart

### Build

```bash
$ aleo build
```

### Scoring

guesses are scored with a set of enums, with one integer per character.

```
2, identical chars and indexes | 
1, identical chars and different indexes | 
0, neither
```

e.g.

challenge: first
guess:     fires
score:     {2,2,2,0,1}

### How to Play
<details><summary>Commands and Playing the Game</summary>

let's create 2 new accounts, player 1 or p1 and p2 respectively. 
```bash
$ aleo account new

>>> Private Key  APrivateKey1zkp6f7VnWKFYQAmfBpjdgP1zVEq8YALgj382A5r9aVJ96hv
     View Key  AViewKey1o2KVZBVejnDpKq3pvXUYundnMpEWyWnRZEFpiFdQh5dU
      Address  aleo1kkjget0dry7jfp62sehr9zgeces2tjsmg2g05r4fewh7er67zsrq340sg9

$ aleo account new

>>> Private Key  APrivateKey1zkp6NzqcM3yniE2gJYYBkRgY9C9fuJThJ2nBk4qEH7foxZx
     View Key  AViewKey1sBKV8eoFcku6xdbY3RLSQy8ssS5Nhg5NapRaGK1TiawT
      Address  aleo1y8jref9s6feavph9925tscwmepzvtrrm3gfemlxe0reezh0j4yys3lvmyy
```

to start the game, p1 needs to create a challenge but first copy p1's creds into the program.json.

next, we need to specify a 5-letter word for p2 to guess. since aleo instructions doesn't support strings, words are to be 
encoded as u64s with encoder.js. we can encode the word "first" like so:

```bash
$ node encoder.js first

>>> 18944928212
```

now we can create a challenge with the encoded word, 18944928212 and salt, 12345678910.

```bash
# aleo run new_challenge <word_as_u64> <salt_u64>

$ aleo run new_challenge 18944928212u64 12345678910u64

next we have to create a player_challenge to issue to a specific player. _in future iterations this record will maintain 
game state_

```bash
# aleo run new_player_challenge <player_address> <challenge>

$ aleo run new_player_challenge aleo1y8jref9s6feavph9925tscwmepzvtrrm3gfemlxe0reezh0j4yys3lvmyy '{

now switch to p2 and create a guess.

encode the word "fires"

```bash
$ node encoder.js fires

create guess

```bash
